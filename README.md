Welcome to my humble little machine learning project. 

The file you are looking for is called "Meatandpotatoes.py". Why? I don't remember. 

When you run the file, it will prompt you with questions such as:
"What stock do you want to train" (the input should be the ticker, i.e for Tesla the input will be "TSLA")
"What time period would you like" (How far back should the data go)


The program saves models and data collected so you don't have to retrain every time. Its a quality of life thing and can be commented out
if necessary. 

If you have any questions please let me know at:
